Assignment 2: Interactive Slack bot that implements NYTimes Top Stories API
Kelly Xie, PPDS Spring 2017


1. How to interact with ‘NewsBot’:

ASK “@user_id bot what is the latest news on XXXXX”
Note: the query is not case sensitive, i.e. “Trump”, “trump”, “tRuMP” should return the same results


2. Two python notebooks:
	
	SlackBot_FetchFromDatabase.ipynb
	SlackBot_FetchFromURL.ipynb

The first one fetches data from MySQL’NYT_TopStories’ database from host (34.199.88.98). This is the one that is running in the background.

The second fetches data directly from the API url.
